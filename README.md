# Interactive Map of My Parent's Trip to the US


Used FoliumMaps to create an interactive map of my parents’ visit to the U.S. It uses:
-	FoliumMaps functions to allow for the control of the map layers view, zoom settings, dynamic marker appearance based on user input
-	Pandas – to read and manipulate cvs files
-	GIS – to transform addresses to latitude and longitude
-	Snippets of JavaScript to enhance user interactions
-	HTML links to give user more info of the visited places
